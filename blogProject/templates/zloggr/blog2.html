                <p>Let’s go to one of my favourite portable air conditioner of 2021 – the “Blaux Portable AC”</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">WHAT ARE PORTABLE AIR CONDITIONERS?</h2>

                <p>Portable air conditioners also known as portable A/C unit or portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed unit.</p>

                <p>Hose systems, which can be “monoblock” or air-to-air, are vented to the outside via air ducts. The “monoblock” type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The air-to-air type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously. Such portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct.</p>

                <p>Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">WHY PORTABLE AC</h2>

                <p>We all love summer, the feeling of the sun on our skin after a long freezing winter, the warm breeze cursing through our hair, let’s not even get started with all the fun on the beach, feeling the warmth of the soil on our toes, laying on the floor and watching the clear beautiful skies.</p>

                <p>But on some days, it could be so frustratingly hot, so hot you might not even want to go out. Being indoors becomes uncomfortable, so that brings us to one of the most important inventions (of course after the internet and only in the summer) the “Portable Air Conditioner”.</p>
               
                <p>Portable ac’s are at an advantage because they are very easy to install, cheap and very, very portable.</p>
