          <h2 class="section-heading">HOW IS MY DATA AT RISK?</h2>

          <p>We all know that computers are not smart, they don’t know what a dog looks like neither do they know what a cat looks like. But if enough data is collected, stored and processed and a proper algorithm is written with accurate statistics, computers might just be able to know what is what and who is who. As tech companies embark on the race for Machine Learning (ML) and therefore Artificial Intelligence (AI), data values has now gone up. Data now in today’s economy is more valuable than real estate, oil and even gold. Big tech companies has now turned to more shady means now to achieve this data. From simple things such as cookies can keep track of all your daily activities. Your YouTube history shows what you’ve watched, the maps installed on your phone can now show where you’ve been and for how long you were there. Such examples goes on and on, and mind you, all these is without your permission.</p>        

          <h2 class="section-heading">HOW DOES VPN'S WORK?</h2>

          <p>A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. The benefits of a VPN include increases in functionality, security, and management of the private network. It provides access to resources inaccessible on the public network and is typically used for telecommuting workers. Encryption is common, although not an inherent part of a VPN connection.</p>

          <p>A VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks. A VPN available from the public Internet can provide some of the benefits of a wide area network (WAN). From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.</p>
